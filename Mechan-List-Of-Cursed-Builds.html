<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This page contains a list of “cursed builds” I or others have used, or tried to use, in AX combat, with varying degrees of success. It is not intended for beginners, and is not intended for general purpose use - as many of these are min/maxed builds that can do little else besides the one fight they were designed for.</p>
<p>Throughout these examples, I will also try to explain the concepts and principles which went into their (often highly unconventional) designs.</p>
<h1>Hydra-solo-capable Adder</h1>

<p>Build and combat notes:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Armed Apex Shuttle that proved (barely) capable of solo'ing a Thargoid Hydra.</li>
  <li>Needs 1/1/4 pips to work, and a WF5/SC distro to avoid heat spikes, making orbiting in it quite challenging - as the Adder maneuvers poorly on just 1 ENG PIP. (A CE5/SC or even CE5/CC distro spikes quite high, resulting in a lot of damage taken. The 1 PIP in SYS is required to fire the necessary amount of sinks, as a WF5 distro doesn't have enough SYS capacity to fire all 10 without recharging)</li>
  <li>The 716hp hull provides very little in terms of buffer - this is effectively a necro build as 4 limpets will repair all the way up to 100% in between runs, while doing so in less than the shield decay timer of a Hydra (5m19s.)</li>
  <li>On the flip side, module protection is excellent; AFMU use is typically minimal.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Expect a synth-heavy fight if using this ship (ammo, limpets, sinks, some afmu.)</li>
  <li>Highly recommend flying with an empty cargo hold and synthesizing limpets as needed (and dumping any extra ones before engaging) - the penalty for extra tons of weight is very significant on this ship (~4 m/s per ton orbiting velocity)</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>E-Rated Alliance Chieftain</u></i> Ship name: AX-011 "XenoSkillIssue" - 4s Gauss, 2054ms cycle (double-sinking) - 6E Distro (unengineered): 1 / 1 / 4 PIPs - 173/173 m/s orbiting, 335/336 m/s boost (laden/unladen) - 15.3% heat spike (4s, no stagger) - 33s MTToT Hydra Premium (over 60s available sink coverage, double-sinking) - EDSY Link: <a href="https://edsy.org/s/viqvZwj">https://edsy.org/s/viqvZwj</a> Mechan's notes: - Ah, the king of cursed builds. Buy a chieftain, and kit it with the absolute worst-in-slot-options for any given module category (typically E-rated.) Forget about engineering. Then take it for a spin, and learn how much a MetaChief has hidden all your skill issues to-date. Jokes aside, this ship is maybe the very best ship to learn and practice in. It will not carry you in any way shape or form. And yet it has been proven to be Hydra-solo-capable. - This build actually orbits decently (for a cursed build), and has the benefit of not spiking heat at all. It's major (and, I mean, MAJOR) limitation is its speed - Curse level: Extreme (edited)</p>
