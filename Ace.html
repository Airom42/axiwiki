<h1>Ace Leaderboard</h1>

<p>For those who go beyond. This rank is a true test of a pilot's abilities, based on a composite ammo usage, total damage taken, and time taken scale. Use a Chieftain and any combination of Gauss cannons to defeat a Medusa.

Restrictions
- Basic Ammo only
- Ship name must contain 'GTM'
- Hammer gauss are not allowed

Score your fight using the /ace bot command. The top 10 CMDRs will hold the @Ace rank. This is a competitive system and you can lose this rank should someone push you out of the Top 10.</p>
